# Virtualization Based Hardening
# (POC only - can NOT and should NOT be used in production)


## Description
Virtualization Base Hardening (VBH) utilizes Intel Virtualization Technology to provide an infrastructure for other parties to build security policies (such as introspection engine) on top of it in order to protect hardware (Intel platform only), kernel and native container/user space apps.  It is implemented as an out-of tree Linux module and supports Linux version 4.4 or above.  It has 2 components:
1. A slim hypervisor, when installed, turns the host into guest
2. APIs to query and control the hypervisor.  The APIs supports the following functionalities:
    * Query and update general guest info
    * vCPU management
    * Event related: to register event callbacks and to report event
    * Memory/EPT related
    * CR and MSR virtualization related
    * Emulation/Single Step related

For a full list of supported functions, please refer to hypervisor_introspection.h.

## Use Cases
We developed the following use cases so far and we are looking for adding more use cases.
1. Help prevent hardware from being damaged by unsafe modification of CR and MSR registers.  See kernelhardening.c.
2. Help Prevent privilege escalation attack against Linux kernel. (source code not published)
3. Help protect Linux's kernel code against tampering (source code not published)


## How to Use
    - To get source code
        >> git clone https://github.com/intel/vbh.git

    - To compile
        >> cd vbh/sources
        >> make

    - To clean
        >> make clean

    - To install
        >> sudo insmod vmx-switch.ko switch_vmx_on_load=1

    - To uninstall
        >> sudo rmmod vmx_switch

    - To use APIs
    Please refer to the files under test directory for sample usage of every api function.
